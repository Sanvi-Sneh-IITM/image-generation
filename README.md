# ADURS Image Generator

This is a simple, single-file web application for generating images based on user prompts and selected styles. Built with responsive design using Tailwind CSS, it provides a basic interface to simulate image generation.

## Features

*   **Prompt-based Generation:** Input text descriptions for your desired image.
*   **Style Selection:** Choose from various artistic styles (Realistic, Cartoon, Abstract, etc.).
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Single File:** All HTML, CSS (via CDN), and JavaScript are contained within `index.html`.

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Clone this repository or download the `index.html` file.
2.  **Open:** Open `index.html` directly in your web browser.

No special server or build process is required.

## Functionality Notes

Please note that this application *simulates* image generation. When you click "Generate Image," it fetches a random placeholder image from `picsum.photos` and displays it, along with the prompt details. A full-fledged AI image generation backend is beyond the scope of a single-file client-side application.
